Before diving into the technical details, it's important to understand the key concepts and terminology used throughout the Urtentic platform.

## Organizations

An organization represents your company or entity within the Urtentic platform. Each organization can have multiple users with different roles and permissions.

## Users

Users are individuals who have access to your organization's Urtentic dashboard. Users can have different roles:

| Role | Access Level |
|---|---|
| **Owner** | Full access to all features and settings |
| **Admin** | Can manage workflows, verifications, and users |
| **User** | Limited access based on assigned permissions |

## Workflows

A workflow is a customized sequence of verification processes that defines how identity verification should be performed. Workflows can be tailored to specific use cases and compliance requirements.

## Verification Processes

Verification processes are the individual components that make up a workflow:

## Verifications

A verification is an instance of a workflow being executed for a specific individual. Each verification has a unique identifier and status.

## Verification Status

Verifications can have the following statuses:

| Status | Description |
|---|---|
| `STARTED` | Verification has been initiated |
| `RUNNING` | Verification is in progress |
| `SUCCESS` | Verification completed successfully |
| `REJECTED` | Verification failed due to detected issues |
| `NEEDS_REVIEW` | Verification requires manual review |
| `ABANDONED` | Verification was abandoned before completion |

## Identities

An identity represents a verified individual within the system. Multiple verifications can be associated with a single identity.

## Webhooks

Webhooks allow your application to receive real-time notifications about verification events, such as when a verification is completed or requires review.

## API Keys

API keys are used to authenticate requests to the Urtentic API. Each API key consists of two components:

<Info>
Both keys are required for API authentication. Keep your API Secret secure and never expose it in client-side code.
</Info>

| Component | Header | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Public Key (Client ID)** | `X-CLIENT-ID` | Used to identify your application |
| **Private Key (API Secret)** | `Authorization: Bearer` | Used to authenticate API requests |
